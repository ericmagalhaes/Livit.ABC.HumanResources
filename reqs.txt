ABC multinational company requires a website to all employees request absence or leave

through automated system internally in the company. One of the most important features of

this system is to allow the employee to add absence request so the admin can approve it or

not, after this the absence details must be shared through the user calendar.

ABC has asked you to develop an API back-end using ASP.NET Core, which can:


1. Allow the users to login with their Google email.

2. Add an absence request to the system.

3. Allow the Admin can approve or decline the request.

4. Approved requests are shared automatically in the user’s calendar.
